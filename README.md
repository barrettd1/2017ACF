This is a project for my Software Engineering class, taken in Fall 2017 at SUNY New Paltz.
The main purpose is to focus on the software engineering process, 
but we are also required to create a final project displaying these requirements.

In this repository you will find several folders and files.
This will include:
- Project Charter
- Business Requirements Document
- Requirements Part 2
- Design and Implementation

- Files for Website

- App Preview
